# ðŸ§  Pre-trained Models and Datasets Collection

This repository brings together a curated collection of pre-trained models and datasets, created to cut through the noise of searching the internet for reliable and well-documented resources.  
My hope is that this grows into a robust pool of reusable, architecture-level models. **Contributions are very welcome!**

> If you've ever felt lost in the jungle of scattered links and incomplete documentation â€” this is for you. Enjoy!

| Dataset        | Source                                                             |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mnist`        | Provided via `tf.keras.datasets`                                   |
| `cifar10`      | Provided via `tf.keras.datasets`                                   |
| `gtsrb`        | Soon provided via HuggingFace                                      |
| `imagenet2012` | Hosted privately on Hugging Face due to licensing restrictions     |

**Note:**  
`imagenet2012` (ILSVRC 2012) is a large-scale image classification dataset. Its distribution is subject to specific academic/research use restrictions.  
To access this dataset, you must request permission from the official ImageNet website: [https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/).  
Only after approval can you legally download or use the dataset. For this reason, the hosted version is marked as private on Hugging Face.

## How to Use

The repository is organized by dataset. Follow these steps to use a model:

0. **Clone the repository and install requirements**

  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jackperlo/deepvault.git
    cd deepvault
  ```

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

1. **Choose a Dataset**  
  Navigate to the folder of the dataset youâ€™re interested in.

2. **Download or Train a Model**
  Find the corresponding model folder (e.g., `Mnist/CNN/Lenet5`)

  - **(a) Use a Custom Model**  
    Use the corresponding notebook to train or customize your model. Once ready, save it in the desired format (FP32/INT8/UINT8).

  - **(b) Use a Pre-trained Model**  
    Run the provided `download_models.sh` shell script to download the desired model.

    ```bash
    bash download.sh
    ```

3. **Preprocess the Dataset**  
  Use the corresponding `<DS>_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to preprocess the dataset images correctly and store them in the required format.

4. **Evaluate the Model**  
  Run evaluation on a portion or the entirety of the preprocessed dataset using the corresponding `<DS>_models_evaluation.ipynb` and choosing the desired model inside the notebook cells.
